Folder Descriptions:

v_sorghum : contains .lpy files, light files, and custom scripts to calculate light extinction coefficient, k, from virtual sorghum plots. It relies on the opensource software OpenAlea v1.0. 

exp_fields: contains photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) data taken from RIL 63 and RIL 73 in the fields, and scripts used to parse and calculate light extinction coefficient, k.

dw3: contains a .pdf describing genotyping of dwarf-3 locus and .txt of sequence amplified.

qtl: contains penalties used for QTL model selection and QTL model statistics for all phenotypes discussed.
